## General Guidelines

### Sources
You don't have to cite every word, but it's best practice to cite sources for key statements.  It's preferred to source from the OEM directly, or device specific communities.

Links should generally point to the original website, unless the original source is dead, in which case an archive.org link is fine. For this reason, it's a good idea to archive the page now.

### Formatting
When formatting your submission, avoid cramming everything into a single paragraph. Separate the information into logical sections.  
  
If necessary, you can use GitHub's Markdown Alerts to reduce the mental load. However, it's easy to overuse them and make the page extremely cluttered. 

Avoid wrapping entire sentences in link blocks. Try to keep them short.

```patch
- ...and [Unisoc requires a bunch of extra steps to unlock for whatever reason][Unisoc Unlock]...
+ ...and Unisoc requires a bunch of [extra steps to unlock][Unisoc Unlock] for whatever reason...

```
  
The use of text formatting is not necessary and is generally used for "comedic" effect.

### Be Respectful
Please avoid making personal comments about developers or people who work for the companies mentioned. Digs at company identities and branding are absolutely fine.
