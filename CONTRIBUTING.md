## General Guidelines

### Sources
You don't have to cite every word, but it's best practice to cite sources for key statements.  It's preferred to source from the OEM directly, or device specific communities.

Links should generally point to the original website, unless the original source is dead, in which case an archive.org link is fine. For this reason, it's a good idea to archive the page now.

### Formatting
When formatting your submission, avoid cramming everything into a single paragraph. Separate the information into logical sections.  
  
If necessary, you can use GitHub's Markdown Alerts to reduce the mental load. However, it's easy to overuse them and make the page extremely cluttered.  
  
The use of text formatting is not necessary and is generally used for "comedic" effect.

### Images
Please avoid the use of images on the list. If it is impossible to avoid images, they should be hidden under a spoiler and have descriptive alt text.

### Be Respectful
Please avoid making personal comments about developers or people who work for the companies mentioned. Digs at company identities and branding are absolutely fine.

## Adding New Companies

### Grouping
In some situations, a phone farm such as BBK Electronics (now split into Vivo and Oppo) may have multiple phone brands under its belt. If the unlocking process or technology stack is similar, the companies can be grouped together: Oppo and Realme (BBK, using the same OS), Vivo and IQOO (BBK, but using a different OS).

### Sorting
In general, the worse a company is, the higher it will be in the list. 

Companies that do not allow unlocking must go to "⛔ Avoid at all costs!". Sometimes, while it's possible to unlock, the process can be so complicated that a company will be recommended to avoid. (See: Realme, Xiaomi)

Companies that use some sort of online service to unlock must go to "⚠️ Proceed with caution!", regardless of reputation. 

A company is considered "safe" if it follows the standard Android procedure with no additional restrictions. Bonus points for support of custom AVB keys.

### Brief History
If the company allowed unlocking in the past, or had different unlocking methods, it may be useful to devote a paragraph to a historical review.

### Additional Info (Not related to unlocking)
The main focus of this list is bootloader unlocking, but other related topics may also be mentioned. It's best to mention them in one sentence and link to a source, rather than explaining them at length.

Related topics include, but are not limited to: rooting, custom operating systems, ADB.
