# Bootloader Unlock: Wall of Shame
Keeping track of companies that "care about your data ðŸ¥º"

## Why?
Over the past few years, a suspicious number of companies have started to "take care of your data", aka block/strictly limit your ability to unlock the bootloader on your *own* devices.

While this may not affect you directly, it sets a bad precedent and it might be a good idea to keep track of companies and workarounds.

# The list:

## Avoid at all cost!

### 1. Huawei/Honor
In the past, Huawei allowed you to unlock by submitting some information to emui.com (IMEI, serial, model, and product ID), but in 2018 "corporate values have changed" and the site went down. <br/>
Worse, on Android 10+, the unlock command has been **completely removed** from fastboot.

But for some models, it's still possible to unlock.

Kirin 620, Kirin 650, Kirin 655, Kirin 658, Kirin 659, Kirin 925, Kirin 935, Kirin 950, Kirin 960:<br/>
It's possible to unlock using testpoints and https://github.com/mashed-potatoes/PotatoNV (Read the readme)

Older models, through bruteforce:<br/>

Paid methods:<br/>
I don't recommend paid methods due to general sketchiness. I have used one of these tools a while ago, it was okay.<br/>
Through HCU-client (Not everything is supported + incredible prices https://hcu-client.com/buy/) or DC-Unlocker (Same problems as HCU https://www.dc-unlocker.com/buy)
