# Samsung

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

If you have a North American device, well, uh... If you're lucky enough not to update for a while, you can check out [this paid service](https://xdaforums.com/t/android-unsamlock-bootloader-unlock-for-samsung-us-canada-devices.4215101/). (At your own risk)

If you bought your phone elsewhere, and it's not carrier locked, you can use the standard process, but brace yourself for all the breakage coming your way!

For example, unlocking will permanently trip Knox. As a result, *any* Knox-based features will be broken *even if you re-lock*. This includes, but not limited to: Samsung Pay, Pass, Flow, Health, Secure Folder, Secure Wi-Fi, Smart View. Can you be denied warranty? Probably...
Some of those features can be fixed with this LsPosed module [KnoxPatch](https://github.com/BlackMesa123/KnoxPatch) and this Magisk Module [KnoxPatch#knoxpatch-enhancer](https://github.com/BlackMesa123/KnoxPatch#knoxpatch-enhancer).

In addition, some basic features can, and will probably break, such as VoLTE, (thanks to Samsung's proprietary implementation) and in certain cases [even the camera](https://xdaforums.com/t/a52s-5g-sm-a528b-unlock-bootloader-camera-failed.4336007/).
