- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

To start off, to unlock your bootloader you have to submit a request on their website, which is pretty bad on its own (*wink* Huawei). But how do you know if your device is unlockable? Well...

* [This page](https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/87215) says that "Most of our latest devices support our bootloader unlock program."
* [This page](https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/standalone/bootloader/unlock-your-device-a) says only "Photon Q 4G LTE, DROID RAZR M(Developer Edition), DROID RAZR HD(Developer Edition CDMA-LTE), MOTOROLA RAZR HD (Rest of World -UMTS/LTE), MOTOROLA RAZR HD (Rogers Canada - UMTS/LTE) and MOTOROLA RAZR i are supported by the Bootloader Unlock site."
* [And from this conversation](https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-guide-unlocking-using-deeptest-gdpr.4585829/post-88734665) [turistu](https://github.com/turistu) had with their support: "most of our E devices doesn't support bootloader unlock program. Please see below a list of devices that support the bootloader unlock program : g100, g51 , g71 , g200 , g52 , g82 , g42 , g62 , g32"
* There's also an unofficial way with CID to check if your device can be unlocked, check here: [xdaforums.com](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-un-locking-motorola-bootloader.4079111/post-85375429)
* Motorola also requires the phone to have a stable internet connection for at least a week for the bootloader to be unlocked, this is not mentioned anywhere on the unlock website but has been confirmed by [posts on the Motorola development forum](https://forums.lenovo.com/topic/findpost/15261/5289637/6254146)


> Moto used confusion! It seems pretty effective...
