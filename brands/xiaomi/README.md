- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

While this (currently) only affects users in China, Xiaomi's new policy makes unlocking very annoying. 

With this new policy, **You must have a Level 5 developer Xiaomi Community account.** </br>
And here's a list of things you have to do to get that:
- You must be a citizen of China.
- You have to use HyperOS and report at least 1 bug per day. (????)
- You have to submit at least 1 HyperOS suggestion per month. (????)
- You must be an active Xiaomi Community user.

Additional BS applies:
- The permission to unlock is temporary and is granted for 1-year only.
- You can only unlock 3 devices per-year.
- You will not receive OTA updates.
- your warranty will be void.

> [!NOTE]
> While not as extreme, if [xiaomiui.net][global-requirements] is to be believed, global unlock has also undergone some changes:
> * Your Mi Account has been active for more than 30 days.
> * Xiaomi Community App version 5.3.31 or above.
> * You can only unlock the bootloader of 3 devices per year with your account.
