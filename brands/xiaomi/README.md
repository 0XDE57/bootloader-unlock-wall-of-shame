# Xiaomi/Redmi/POCO

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

In the past, Xiaomi allowed most of its devices to be unlocked after a period of 7+ days (depending on how new the device is).

With the launch of Xiaomi's new Android fork, HyperOS, they have introduced a number of changes to the unlock process, with new device limits and Mi Account requirements.

### China

> ðŸ§¹ Missing a source for China Requirements.

With the new policy, **You must have a Level 5 developer Xiaomi Community account.** </br>
And here's a list of things you have to do to get that:
- You must be a citizen of China.
- You have to use HyperOS and report at least 1 bug per day. (????)
- You have to submit at least 1 HyperOS suggestion per month. (????)
- You must be an active Xiaomi Community user.

Additional BS applies:
- The permission to unlock is temporary and is granted for 1-year only.
- You can only unlock 3 devices per-year.
- You will not receive OTA updates.
- your warranty will be void.

### Global

While not as extreme, if [xiaomiui.net][global-requirements] is to be believed, global unlock has also undergone some changes:
* Your Mi Account has been active for more than 30 days.
* Xiaomi Community App version 5.3.31 or above.
* You can only unlock the bootloader of 3 devices per year with your account.

## Android One

Devices shipping with Android One do NOT have any unlock requirements. They follow the standard Android unlock process.
