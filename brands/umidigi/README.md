# Umidigi

* Verdict **ℹ️ "Safe for now" :trollface:**

Umidigi phones are generally unlockable, however due to them being a budget-focused manufacturer, they use Unisoc SoCs, and [Unisoc requires a bunch of extra steps to unlock for whatever reason][Unisoc Unlock], and therefore I wouldn't consider them completely safe. MediaTek Umidigi devies can just use flashing unlock/oem unlock in fastboot.
