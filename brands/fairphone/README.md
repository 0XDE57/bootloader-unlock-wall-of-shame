# Fairphone

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

No, wait, I have a point.

All Fairphones after 2 require you to request a code from [this][unlock-website] website to enable OEM unlock. There is nothing stopping them from requiring an account and having device unlock limits in the future. This is "proceed with caution" after all.

Not very fair in my opinion, but whatever fairs your phone.

> They also [broke Verified Boot][verified-boot], lol
