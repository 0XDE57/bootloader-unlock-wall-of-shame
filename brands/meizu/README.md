# Meizu

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

There's not a lot to say about Meizu.<br/>
They've never had unlockable bootloaders, and although there are a number of unofficial methods. Some Snapdragon devices have a [FRP exploit you can use in EDL to unlock](https://github.com/sukanka/MEIZU16S_unlock_tutorial/wiki/FRP-Method), If your device is unsupported by the FRP exploit and isn't supported by mtkclient, there are [paid services](https://github.com/sukanka/MEIZU16S_unlock_tutorial/wiki/Unlock-Bootloader) which you can use at your own risk.
