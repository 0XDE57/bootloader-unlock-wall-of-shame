# Sony

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

Sony has an open policy for software developers:
- They are releasing AOSP sources under [Sony Open Devices Program].
- Jolla provides first-class support for installing [Sailfish OS] on select Xperias. That wouldn't be possible without Sony's openness.

Since Sony likes to ruin a perfect thing:
- Sony requires you to request an unlock code from [their servers][Unlock Service]. They can pull the plug anytime. You have to send your IMEI and agree to warranty voiding.
