# HMD Global/Nokia

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

In the flaming pile of HMD's "great" decisions to improve Nokia, one stands out more than others: They decided to follow the fresh "lock the bootloader" trend.<br/>
Why was this necessary? I don't know...

Well, anyway. Models released before early 2019 can request unlocking using Hikari Calyx's unofficial service [hikaricalyx.com](https://hikaricalyx.com/request-bootloader-unlock)

And for some other models, Hikari Calyx has a repo with prototype ABLs. [fih-firmware.hikaricalyx.com](https://fih-firmware.hikaricalyx.com/protoabl/)

Models 7.2, 8.3 and 5.3 can be unlocked offline, while others may require HMD Device Kit **which is not public and requires a service account.**

As for Windows Phones, most models have an [unofficial method](http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/24245_Aguideforunlockingthebootloade.php) of unlocking, which is supported by most Nokia Lumias, except for the 620, 720, and 1320.
