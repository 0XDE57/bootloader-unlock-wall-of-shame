# OnePlus

> ☢️ This info is just speculation!

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

What? OnePlus? Aren't their phones super easy to unlock? - yes, but... <br/>
You probably heard about the OnePlus X OPPO os merger and while it did get called off, both companies started sharing a "unified codebase". You can probably see where I'm going.

If one day OnePlus decides to practice racism like Realme or go nuclear like OPPO/Vivo, they'll have those "unified" tools at their disposal.
