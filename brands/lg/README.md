# LG

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

In the past, LG had a developer portal which could be used to unlock phones on their website, however it only supported international models of their phones, but in December 2021, LG announced the developer portal would be shutting down due to LG ending production of all phones. On some models (such as the Stylo 3 Plus and G6), the bootloader can be unlocked via `fastboot oem unlock` **only if** [the phone is a T-Mobile model.](https://xdaforums.com/t/unlock-bootloader-tmo.3578099/)
