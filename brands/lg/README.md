# LG

- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

In the past, LG had a developer portal which could be used to unlock phones on their website, however it only supported international models of their phones, but in December 2021, LG [announced][announcement-archive] the developer portal would be shutting down due to LG ending production of all phones. 

On some models (such as the Stylo 3 Plus and G6), the bootloader can still be unlocked via `fastboot oem unlock` **only if** [the phone is a T-Mobile model][t-mobile-unlock].
