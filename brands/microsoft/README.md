# Microsoft

- Verdict: **⚠️ Proceed with caution!**

While Microsoft doesn't provide an official unlocking method, an [unofficial method][android-unlock] has been available for their Android devices basically ever since Microsoft began making Android phones, and Microsoft hasn't bothered to patch it, and Windows is possible to run on an unlocked bootloader Surface Duo, so it seems like the bootloader will remain unlockable for now, but do note Microsoft can patch the unofficial method at any time.

As for Windows Phones, once again, no official methods, but an [unofficial method][win-phone-unlock] has been around for a while, and supports all Mirosoft-made Lumias except for the 540 and 535, as Windows Phone hasn't been supported since 2017, it is highly unlikely this is going to be patched.
