- Verdict: **â›” Avoid!**

This one is probably expected. No iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch or Apple TV model has had an unlockable bootloader. Depending on your device or SoC, there are BootROM (hardware based) and iBoot (software based) exploits you can use to run unsigned code on iOS devices, such as [checkm8 for A5-A11,](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit) [limera1n for A4, iPod touch 3G, and iPhone 3GS](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Limera1n_Exploit) [24kpwn for certain iPod touch 2G's and iPhone 3GS's](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/0x24000_Segment_Overflow) and [steaks4uce for iPod touch 2G's](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Usb_control_msg(0xA1,_1)_Exploit) for BootROM exploits, and [DRA for all 32-bit devices running iOS 7.x.x](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/De_Rebus_Antiquis) for iBoot exploits.
